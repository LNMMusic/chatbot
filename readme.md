1. User sends input

2. Create Centralized Processing System:
   - Identification / Clasification: based on users input, it will be filtered to get the main topic the user is talking about (science, math, news, animals, etc)

   - Generation: generates a text output based on topic (science, math, news, animals, etc) and later can use context tokens to give dynamics and variation to the response

Tips: generation must be descentralized, as it will be more scalable and modular and manteinable. Create different engine generators on diverse topics and later mix responses based on probability of the categorization

3. CPS sends output

4. Add a Vocal Sound Layering

Further Improvements:
- Add technique of "Attention Mechanism" to use context during the 2 main process
- Start descentralization


el proceso A, es facil, el proceso B, es mas complejo
el proceso C, la mezcla de capas va a tener mayor dificultad para encontrar datasets
